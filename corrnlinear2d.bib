  note="For the hexagonal-BN we used a lattice constant of $a=2.52~\AA$, and an inter-layer distance of 20 a.u. The electron-ion term was approximated using norm conserving pseudo-potentials and exchange correlation term using the local density approximation. The $GW$ correction of 3.3 eV was taken from Refs.~\cite{PhysRevLett.96.126104,PhysRevLett.100.189701}. The screened Coulomb interaction was calculated using 30 bands and a cutoff of 2 Ha on the dielectric matrix dimensions. SHG was obtained using 8 bands: 4 valence and 4 conduction. Within IP and TDH we used a $40\times40\times1$ k-point grid, within TDSHF the optical spectra is dominated by a strongly bound exciton and a $14\times 14\times 1$ k-point grid is sufficient to converge the spectra."

@misc{intequation,
note="Calculations of $H_\kk^0$ are performed with {\sc Abinit}~\cite{abinit}, while Eq.~\eqref{tdbse_shf} is solved using a developer version of the {\sc Yambo} code~\cite{yambo}, where also Eq.~\eqref{berryP} have been implemented.
Equation~\eqref{tdbse_shf} is numerically integrated with a time-step of $\Delta t = 0.0025$~fs, that guarantees accuracy and stable results. In order to reproduce experimental conditions we use a laser intensity of $I = 500~$kW/cm$^2$. We add a dephasing term with $\tau=6$~fs in Eq.~\ref{tdbse_shf} to simulate a finite broadening of about $0.2~eV$~\cite{nloptics2013}, and propagate Eq.~\eqref{tdbse_shf} for $55$~fs for each laser frequency."

@MISC{mos2parameters,
    note="For the MoS$_2$ layer we used the experimental lattice constant of the bulk MoS$_2$ as in Ref.~\cite{molina2013effect} and an inter-layer distance of 30 a.u. The electron-ion term was approximated using norm conserving pseudo-potentials and exchange correlation term using the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof functional [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)]. The $GW$ correction of $0.72~eV$  was taken from Ref.~\cite{molina2013effect}. The screened Coulomb interaction was calculated using 100 bands and a cutoff of 2 Ha on the dielectric matrix dimensions. SHG was obtained using a $21\times21\times1$ k-point grid, 18 bands within IPA and TDH, and bands between the 3$^\text{rd}$ and the 16$\text{th}$ for the TDSHF."
