	optical susceptibility. The results are based on an ab initio treatment
	of the geometry and the electronic structure within the density-functional
	theory in local-density approximation. The plane-wave-pseudopotential
	method is combined with a generalized tetrahedron method to perform
	the k-space integration. The analytic linear tetrahedron method has
	to be improved because of the energy-dependent prefactors of the
	delta functions describing the energy conservation. We also present
	results for spectra of the second-harmonic generation where many-body
	quasiparticle effects are included beyond the scissors-operator approximation.
	Zinc-blende semiconductors are considered as model substances.}},

	$10,7$~\AA~inter-tube distance. Dielectric constant has been calculated
	using $520$ bands. In all real-time calculations bands between the
	48th and 80th have been employed. A cutoff has been applied to the
	Coulomb potential in the $x$ and $y$ direction\cite{PhysRevB.73.205119}
	in order to reduced the inter-tube interaction. A scissor operator
	was applied in such a way to reproduce the results of ref. \cite{PhysRevLett.96.126104,PhysRevLett.100.189701},
	and the direction of the perturbing external field $\mathbf E(t)$
	was $(0,0,1)$. A dephasing and a radiative term, respectivelly of
	$7.5$~fs and $15.0$~fs has been added in the time-dependent dynamics.
	All others calculation details are the same of ref. \cite{calculations}.}

	a $8\times8\times4$ k-point sampling, the local-density approximation for the exchange-correlation functional~\cite{ceperley}, Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials~\cite{troullier},
	and a plane wave cutoff of 40\,Ry. All DFT calculations have been
	performed with the {\sc Abinit} code\cite{abinit}. {\it Ai}-MBPT calculations have been performed using the {\sc Yambo} code.~\cite{yambo}
        For the $G_0 W_0$ we
	used 60 bands to calculate the dielectric constant and to expand
	the Green's functions. For the dielectric matrix size we used a cutoff
	of $2$~Ha on the reciprocal lattice vectors and the plasmon-pole model as implemented
	in the {\sc Yambo} code\cite{yambo}. For the BSE, we use the

@MISC{dipoles,

	is known that they do not affect optical properties of semiconductors
	and insulators within linear regime, and it is not clear yet how
	much they are relevant beyond linear optics, see ref. \cite{PhysRevB.52.14636}
	for a discussion. Moreover notice that even in presence of the scissor
	operator, the optical matrix elements derived from the commutation
	relation are not affected at the lowest order by the presence of
	this additional non-local operator\cite{PhysRevB.80.155205,PhysRevB.82.235201}.}
